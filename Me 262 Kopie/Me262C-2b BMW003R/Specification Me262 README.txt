X-Plane ACF model by Uwe F. Reitter / Sulzfeld / Germany


The Czechoslovakian S-92 variant is powered with the Jumo 004B engines
and meets the original performance very close (900 kilopond thrust, this engine saw duty in WW2)

The other 4 variants have different loads, individual horizontal stab trim
and the Jumo004D engine (1050 kp) which passed testing and was ready
to enter production in place of the 004B, when the war ended.

The Me262 airframe seems designed for slightly stronger engines than the initial 004B,
it shows much better curving for dogfight with the 004D engines. Because of their low mountings
the behaviour at slow manovers is almost as with thrust vectoring.


BASIC POH:
( See also the complete and very interesting Pilot`s Handbooks as PDFs at
http://www.zenoswarbirdvideos.com/Flying_the_Me-262.html )

Always run up the engines especially slowly up to 85% RPM. Otherwise the Jumo004
engines will overheat and be weakened by cavitation in the compressor stage.
So in any flight situation when you can expect an immediate need of full thrust
never decrease the N1 RPM below 85%. (no need to in the simulator)

Best center of gravity is with fore tank full and aft tank empty. CG instrument shows green.
With filled aft tank the elevation stability is reduced and the elevator has to be trimmed
nose heavy. For some situations (262vs262 combat, aerobatics) it might be useful
to trimm bit backwards. The RTT plugin loads at startup the fore tank full, the aft tank half full,
set fuel selector to aft and switches automatically to fore tank when aft is empty.

TAKE OFF:
Hold the aircraft stationary until 85% RPM. Then release the brakes and give full throttle.
Directional corrections should only be made with the brakes. (no need in the simulator)
Rotate up at 190 - 200 kmh (fully laden, interceptor) or 200 - 220 kmh (fully laden, bomber/C2/U1/U4)
After becoming airborne, immediately push forward slightly to gain the optimum climbing speed,
never more slowly than 475 kmh true at 0 m -2000 m altitude .

LANDING:
Retract gun sight with the button ZG (Zielgerät).
The best approach speed is 230 - 250 kmh. Shortly before reaching the airfield boundary,
decrease the glide angle a little and reduce the speed to about 200 kmh. Then flatten out
and touch down normally at 175 kmh. After touch-down, allow the aircraft to tip forward slowly.
Only apply brakes when the nose wheel has touched the ground.

FLIGHT MANAGING COMPUTER FMS and AUTOPILOT:
Autopilot (not WW-2 authentic) VVI and ALT setting in the related instrument
The wooden clip-board is a disguised FMS and FUEL calculator.
If you decide to do (non WW-2 authentic) GPS and autopilot operations
set the HSI compass source to GPS and press on the FMS clipboard INIT then APT (or VOR or NDB)
and input the ICAO-code of your next waypoint or destination airport.
You can also input a desired flight level for each waypoint.
Append waypoints by pressing next and repeat the input procedure.
When navigation source is set to GPS the autopilot LOC will follow the route,
BC will perform a back-course and VNAV will perform the inputted flight levels,
after you steered your plane manually to the approximate course.
With LD and SA you can save and load your FMS inputs.


SPECIFICATIONS:

INTERCEPTOR A-1a Jumo 004 (2x 1040 kp J004D)  and S-92 (2x 880 kp J004B)
Smoothest to fly, very agile plane. Empty 8,376 lbs, max. take-off weight 14,110 lbs.
Horizontal stab has small positive incidence to pitch the plane down a bit.

PROTOTYPE C-2b BMW 003R (2x+2x 1000 kp one unit was buildt):
Heaviest variant, 3rd fueltank in aft section. Drop tanks.
The BMW 003R integral rockets provide additional 1000kp thrust each,
max. take-off load is by 2,000 lbs increased. The dry center of gravity has moved to bow by setting
engines forward. Horizontal stab has small positive incidence, plane needs higher airspeed to stabilize its mass.

FIGHTER-BOMBER A-2a (2x 1040 kp):
Variable weapon mass at bow pods. Horizontal stab is set to give same trim
as the Interceptor with the 21cm Nebel rockets mounted.

BOMBER-GROUP-DESTROYER A-1a/U4 (2x 1040 kp):
Thw 50 mm ! gun was meant to down bomber from outside their defense gun range.
Heavy mass in front needs more airspeed for neutral trim and to stabilize oscillation.
Horizontal stab has little negative incidences to pitch the plane up a bit.
