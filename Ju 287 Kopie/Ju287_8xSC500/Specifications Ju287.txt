
Junkers Ju287 projected medium german jet bomber
Operational aircraft bases on the V3 prototype specifications.

X-Plane ACF model by Uwe F. Reitter / Sulzfeld / Germany

VERY BASIC POH:

Always run up the engines especially slowly up to 85% RPM. Otherwise the
original engines may overheat and be weakened by cavitation in the compressor stage.
So in any flight situation where you can expect an immediate need of full thrust
never decrease the RPM smaller than 85%. (no need in the simulator)

TAKE OFF:
Hold the aircraft stationary until 85% RPM. Then release the brakes and give full throttle.
Directional corrections should only be made with the brakes. (no need in the simulator)
Rotate up at 260 - 270 kmh (fully laden, interceptor)
After becoming airborne, immediately push forward slightly to gain the optimum climbing speed,
never more slowly climbing than 475 kmh true at 0 m -2000 m altitude .

LANDING:
Retract gun sight with the button ZG (Zielgerät).
The best approach speed is 260 - 270 kmh. Shortly before reaching the airfield boundary,
decrease the glide angle a little and reduce the speed to about 230 kmh. Then flatten out
and touch down normally at 200 kmh. After touch-down, allow the aircraft to tip forward slowly.
Only apply brakes when the nose wheel has touched the ground.
