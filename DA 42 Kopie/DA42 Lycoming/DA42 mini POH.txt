X-Plane ACF models by Uwe F. Reitter / www.RTTdesign.eu


LIMITATIONS:
The flight displays have no Garmin G900X functionalities.
But the ACF cockpit tries to show an authentic basic garmin plot.
Future versions of the ACF will show these more realistic by intense plugin programming.

3D cockpit:
To look around in the animated 3D cockpit set such joystick buttons,
or
use STRG-period to activate the 3D cockpit and use the arrow keys.

EXTERNAL CAMERAS: (plug-in)
Use RTTkey to parse through them. Zoom:arrow keys / Direction:mouse / Default view: mouse re-center.
Exit camera views by activating any regular X-plane view.
If a turret cam is present, the view will alter to night google automatically if it is dark.

CUSTOM PAYLOADS:
The plug-in automatically sets the payload to suit the displayed number of persons of the 3D cockpit.
Additional payload by setting weights-balance of X-plane (resutlts in weight exactly at the center of gravity)
OR (prefered) you can distribute mass by placing weights and luggage "weapons", leaving the payload slider untouched.
(This leads to a more realistic behavior regarding stall and inertia of masses)
